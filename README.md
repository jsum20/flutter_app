# Flutter App

The objective of this project is to create a Flutter application that integrates with a provided API to manage and display user shifts.  
The application allows for a user to view their shifts in a monthly calendar and interact with individual shifts.  
There is a Clock-in and Clock-out feature with required time and location validations.
